NHL95DBEditor is a console program for parsing and modifying the database files of EA Sports NHL Hockey 95 for PC.

My main interest is in updating and adding information (especially more teams!) to the databases, so there will be no fancy GUI for the editor. The project is in its early stages, I'm still figuring out the contents of the game database files.
